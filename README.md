# Interactive map of IIT Palakad

Our project, Interactive Map, enables its user to search locations of different places and helps them to reach their destination within Ahalia campus of IIT Palakkad. Many of the rookies to our campus often find it difficult to reach their destinations and there were some incidents when some guys lost their ways and struggled to find a path. So we decided to create a map that would help us to travel within Ahalia campus.
